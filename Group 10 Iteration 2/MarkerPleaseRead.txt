For our minor release, we have completed the functionality of 
our use cases, but there are certain parts of the program that are not
yet functional.

Right now when the user clicks "Start Game" the program builds a number of boards
based on the number of players selected, but the boards can't be interacted with
and the images on each tile are placeholders (right now just a picture of a snowman).

In later iterations, we will implement more game functionality than just displaying
the game boards.
